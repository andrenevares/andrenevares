## My code

```
import csv
import psycopg2

#connect into the db
con = psycopg2.connect(
            host="...",
            database="...",
            user="...",
            password="...",
            port="5432")

with open('books.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    next(csv_reader)

    for line in csv_reader:
        #index 2 print just the third columns it just shows the author
        #our csv contains isbn[0] / title[1] / author[2] / year[3] 
        isbn = line[0]
        title = line[1]
        author = line[2]
        year_published = line[3]
        #cursor
        cur = con.cursor()  
        #execute query
        cur.execute('INSERT INTO "book" (isbn, title, author, year_published) VALUES (isbn, title, author, year_published)')
        #Close the cursor
        cur.close()
#close the connection
con.close()
```
